Work Done so far by Aman:
-Nickname feature is functional, however, it needs to work for all Users not just the Current User. 
	-Currently, working on the fix now.
-Delete User Feature: deletes from the Hash map, need to determine how to delete from whole system. (I have a feeling it has to do something with the server files.)
-Handle Duplicate Usernames: Trying to understand the Serializers.java file in order to determine how exactly to retrieve all Usernames and do a comparison to see if the new user that is trying to be created has the same name as one already created.
