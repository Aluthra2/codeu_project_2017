Aman's Work:
-getAlias() method works - returns the nickname of the user
-deletUser() method works and server code is fully implemented
Problems:
	-Nicknames won't work
		-I need more help on this becasue I have no clue why it won't work
Still Need to implement:
-Duplicate Users - Probably will have it return an error if the username is already taken-Can be done fairly quickly
