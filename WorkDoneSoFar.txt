Work Done so far by Aman:
-Nickname feature is functional, however, it needs to work for all Users not just the Current User. 
	-Currently, working on the fix now.
-Delete User Feature: deletes from the Hash map, need to determine how to delete from whole system. (I have a feeling it has to do something with the server files.)
-Handle Duplicate Usernames: Trying to understand the Serializers.java file in order to determine how exactly to retrieve all Usernames and do a comparison to see if the new user that is trying to be created has the same name as one already created.

Work Done so far by Cristina:
-Appended both the ClientMessage.java file and the chat.java file
-ClientMessage: I added a Hashmap to store all messages sent by a specific user. The key to the map is the string of the user's ID while the value of every key is an array list storing all of the messages sent by that user. These messages will be added to the hashmap in the add message method. The SearcbyID method takes in a string containing a user id and prints all of the messages that user has sent. This method currently is only displaying the last message and has to be fixed.
-Chat.java: In this file I added the case where the user enters searchid. This will call the searchbyID method using the user typed string as a parameter. I want to change this in the future to make it so that the user will only have to type the name of the user rather than the entire id.
-In the future this search method may also take another parameter for tags to search and display all of the messages where a user used a tag.
